# A Custom Robot Arduino


Code and libraries for a custom little Robot Arduino.


## Structure

* `3D_Files` stores the CAO files in STEP and EASM format. Open it with a free CAO viewer. The robot can be build with a 3D print machine.
* `Adafruit_Motor_Shield_V2` must be used with the robot.
* `Datasheets` stores the hardware files of the robots.
* `Examples1` stores really simple examples if you are beginners 
* `Examples2` uses the Wifi of the robot and are much more difficult if you begin with Arduino.


## How to use it

* Clone this repo.
* Copy the `Adafruit_Motor_Shield_V2` repertory into your Arduino libraries repertory.
* Launch your Arduino IDE, the `Adafruit_Motor_Shield_V2` must appears in the libraries menu list.
* Try the examples !
